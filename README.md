A self-revision practice of the MERN stack. 

DIY ELECTRICALS

This is a simple application for electrical/electronic enthusiasts 
to share their knowledge on common electrical components, and self DIY projects
which can enhance one's knowledge in electrical/electronics industry.

Using this application, users can post projects to share with the community, or post
common components details for community to view.

In this MERN revise stack,

- For backend authentication, passport and jwt is used instead of sessions, which was utilised 
in my previous project
- For css, bootstrap is used instead of material UI.
